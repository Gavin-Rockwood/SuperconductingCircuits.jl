# SuperconductingCircuits

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Gavin-Rockwood/SuperconductingCircuits.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Gavin-Rockwood/SuperconductingCircuits.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

**This project is currently on hold! I want to rebuild from the ground up where the fundamental representation of the systems is purely symbolic. This would allow for symbolic analysis of circuits as well as making it easier to do numerical analysis in differnt bases/frames).
